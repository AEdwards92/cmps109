Assignment 1, Advanced Programming
Unix Shell Emulation

This assignment emulates the unix shell. Users can create text files and
directories and get information on the current state of the shell.

The available commands are:
    cat pathname...             File contents displayed
    cd [pathname]               Change working directory
    echo [words...]             Output the input
    exit [status]               Exit with given status, 0 by default
    ls [pathname...]            Describe files and directories
    lsr [pathname...]           As above, but recursive
    make pathname [words...]    Create a file, optionally with words as
                                data
    mkdir pathname              Create a directory
    prompt string               Change the shell's prompt
    pwd                         Print the full path from the root to
                                the current working directory
    rm pathname                 Removes file or directory at pathname,
                                though directories must be empty
    rmr pathname                As above, but recursive (directories
                                need not be empty).
